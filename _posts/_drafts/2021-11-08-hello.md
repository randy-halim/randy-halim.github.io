I've finally stop procrastinating and created a blog! Without using WordPress or anything too janky!

(For reference: this is using Jekyll via GitHub Pages. You can see the source [here](https://github.com/randy-halim/randy-halim.github.io))

And since I actually have a website now that _doesn't need 900 lines of HTML_, I can do other things besides ramble on via blogs. So I guess this is where I say to check back for cool things!
