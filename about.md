# about

I'm currently a 1st year student at the [University of Washington Bothell](https://www.uwb.edu/), majoring in
Computer Science & Software Engineering with Information Security, and minoring in Retail Management. I previously
graduated Bellevue College with an [Associates in the Arts & Sciences](https://www.parchment.com/u/award/db9110fc4cb9b1d902ef3d4fdc8fcecc).

I have previous experience working in various programming languages such as `Java`, `C#`, and `JavaScript/TypeScript`,
and I am familiar with frameworks and libraries such as [`Micronaut`](https://micronaut.io/), `ASP.NET`, `React.JS`, and `Next.js`.

When not working with technology, I also worked several projects with [Main Home Solutions](https://www.mainhomesolutions.com/),
including working with the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe to create a walkway for their Early Childhood Development Center.
