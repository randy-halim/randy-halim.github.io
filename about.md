# about me

howdy! you're likely here because you want to know about me. there isn't much to know to be honest. but if you really want to know...

currently a high school senior, also in running start. heavy interest on anything that contains "compute" as well as other, normal human hobbies, such as guitar, videomaking, etc. i do many things, and not much at the same time. yeah, it gets confusing for me also.

child at heart. worries too much.

did i mention i have a website? you can visit me at https://fcrh.me!

...

wait. you're already on it. ANYWAYS, i also have socials, so you can see me simultaneously vibe and not vibe at the same time! either [twitter](https://twitter.com/fcrh__), [instagram](https://instagram.com/fcrh__), or discord at `fc.randy.h [hashtag] 1125`. i do have an email, but don't publish it for spam reasons.

## what do i do?

some of the several things i do because 1. why not, and 2. because i enjoy it/for the betterment of myself:

- [the Civil Air Patrol](https://gocivilairpatrol.com)! if you're 12-18 years old and want to learn either a. how to be a effective leader, b. learn about aerospace, and/or c. partake in the emergency services world, then the Civil Air Patrol might be a good fit for you!
- play minecraft, and mod it because i can do it
- did i mention code? i know [typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript) and java so far, and hoping to learn more languages soon!
- moral support, because for some reason i have experience... very long story.
- effective planningâ„¢
- screaming into the void (social media is a great gateway to the void)
- and other things that i keep forgetting to put in

## what do i not no?

i don't do many things! such as

- having a social life
- having friends (see point #1)
- having existential crisis (wait... hold on..........)
- and other random things.

wow. that is an amazingly small list.
