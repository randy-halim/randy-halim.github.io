      it may be warranted. it may not. it might hurt me more, it might not. it's
      all

      they tell me not to focus on the past. i guess that is what i'm trying.
      but what about others?
    </p>
    <p>
      after everyone i've hurt, and the lies i kept telling myself, hoping that
      something else will happen. but

      a tv is like a window into the lives and stories of others. you can peek
      into what they do, see the big picture. laugh with them. cry with them.
      but at the end, it's their story, and not mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      and now my world?
      <a href="https://youtu.be/3GvCxDEkxXc?t=52">covered in darkness</a>.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>but perhaps one day, when another star aligns</p>
    <p>
      perhaps i will change. maybe not. all i know is that i've lost a lot, and
      i'm just too scared to admit it. but then again, it's a world where i need
      to
      <a href="https://sive.rs/up2you">assume nobody is going to help you</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      and then again, is it really me? i don't believe it's my nature to abandon
      people. i can't stand to see others get hurt. even if it means... getting
      hurt myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      and so here we are in this endless cycle of questioning and conflict. it
      stops now. pulling the plug, and

    </p>
    <p>
      i'll have to face the music, and face the world again. something tells me
      that. actions, decisions, they have to be made, and for me, neither is
      ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      i wish i could apologize to all the ones i've hurt. i wish i could go back
      and fix everything. i wish i didn't have to go through this.
    </p>
    <p>but, will i ever be accepted again?</p>
